# Infiniminer

It's very easy to find someone trying to fool people with these faked "wallet-mining".
Wallet mining is essentially stealing lost wallets. But sadly many people can's see through these fakes and proceed to get themselves a 
trojan. This is why I made my own version. If you have a friend who showed you something like this, install infiniminer, trick them into believing
you are a genius and then demonstrate how easy it is to do.
